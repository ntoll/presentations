Last year my friend Holger gave a keynote at Europython. It was titled, "The
Return of Peer-to-Peer Computing".

* Provide a reasoned philosophical analysis:
    * The effect of technical architecture on power / politics.
    * The ethics of surveillance.
    * The responsibility of the developer.
    * Reasonable / constructive progress / non-conformance.

* Move the philosophical analysis to a technical context then
  describe how we asked ourselves two questions:
    1. what are the fundamental elements / abstractions for p2p?
    2. assuming answers to 1, what can we build that is useful?

* Describe three solutions we, as a group, considered / discussed:
    1. Implications of Bitcoin. (Global ledger)
    2. P2P chat. (Decentralised messaging)
    3. DHT / Drogulus (P2P naming / datastore)

* Conclude by asking three questions:
    1. On what side of the fence do you sit wrt centralisation?
    2. Given where you "sit", what is your decentralised must have
       application? (e.g. for you it's chat, for me a datastore, for
       all it must probably be economically viable.)
    3. What can you usefully do?

* I'd like attendees to be asking themselves three questions:
    1. What am I doing now that supports the centralised internet (and
       do I agree with it)..?
    2. What do I need to think about / learn..?
    3. What can I usefully do..?
